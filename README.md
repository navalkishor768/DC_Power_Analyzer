Measurement of DC voltage, current and power using Atmega32

Here I have used resistor voltage divider for voltage measurement.

ACS712 current sensor is used for current measurement.

MV_PER_AMP macro is defined for different rating of current sensor like 5A, 20A and 30A module.

Following is the Proteus simulation schematic and video.
